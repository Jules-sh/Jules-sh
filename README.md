# Hi üëãüèº
I'm Julian Schumacher, an 17 year old Student at Philipp-Matth√§us-Hahn School, building and improving my
Coding skills.

## About me
I'm a Student at a Gymnasium with special interest in Technic and Coding. \
But mostly I'm still developing my Skills in my free Time and on my own.

## My Work
Currently I'm developing Apps and Packages with Google's Flutter Framework and the underlying Language Dart. \
I'm also impoving my Kotlin, Java and Swift Skills on the way. \
All my Flutter Apps are running on Android and IOS, most of them on Windows, Linux and macOS too. All on one Codebase.
But I'm not only a Developer, I'm also an UI / UX Designer, which you can see in my App Designs, built with the help of Material Design. In my most recet Apps with Material 3.
But it's always better to see something than to hear it. So why don't you take a look at my Projects and built your one Impression.

## My Setup
### Hardware
I'm the minimalistic type of person, so I only use my MacBook and an external Monitor for development.  

MacBook:
- 2020 MacBook Air
- M1 CPU with 8 CPU Cores and 7 GPU Cores
- 256 GB of Storage
- 16 GB of unified RAM

For Testing I use the Android Emulator that comes with Android Studio and the IOS Simulator that comes with Xcode

### Software
For development I'm currently using Visual Studio Code most of the Time. \
For Android build Configurations I use Android Studio. \
Sometimes I'm coding in Intellij IDEA Community Edition. \
For IOS / macOS Specific Coding I'm using Xcode.


## Organizations:
I'm part of the Jules-Media Organization, an Organization I created myself to manage my Dart and Flutter Plugins / Packages.
